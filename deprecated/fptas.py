    # It will create a square matrix with leaf_count + 1 rows and leaf_count + 1 columns.
    # The first row will be left empty and shall never be looked at.
    # the first colomn should be interpreted as follows: if nothing has been scheduled on the machine, how
    # many symbols should I add to the machine to be able to assign the tile number i (with i a row number). Of
    # course this number equals the size of the tile.
    # Then, the rest of the matrix is used as usual : M[i][j] = number of symbols I must add to a machine if the
    # last scheduled tile is j and if I want to add the tile i.
    #
    # There will be empty cells for two reasons : 
    #       - There is a condition inherent to the method which is i >= j. So this means half of the matrix is empty
    #       - There are as many rows (and columns) as there are leaves in the starting tree but maybe not all of leaves
    #           are kept in the input. The cells for these not-used leaves are left empty (with an 'x' inside in fact)
    #
    # Of course, all the indexes used in the matrix are in LEAF-ONLY index. See the top of
    # this document to have explanation of whats does this mean.
