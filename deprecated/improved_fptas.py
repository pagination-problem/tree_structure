# matrix[i][j] = the quantity to add to a machine if we want to assign to it
# the tile i and if the last tile assigned to it was j

# which means that if j = 4 and i = 7 : we are considering adding the tile [N1, N3, N7, N14]
# with the tile [N1, N2, N5, N11] already assigned. A more detailled explanation is given in the

# In this version of the FPTAS, the state has four members :
# a : completion time on M1
# b : completion time on M2
# k : index of the other last assigned tile on one of the machine. There are two 'last' tiles
#       (the ones on 'top' of M1 and M2) and one of them is i - 1. The other one is k.
# alpha : boolean which says if the tile i - 1 was assigned to M1 or to M2
# The four possible situations are :
# 
#  |_______|     |       |          |_______|     |_______|
#  |___i___|     |_______|          |___i___|     |__i-1__|
#  |__i-1__|     |___k___|          |___k___|     |       |  : We schedule the tile i on M1

    # The first row will be left empty and shall never be looked at.
    # the first colomn should be interpreted as follows: if nothing has been scheduled on the machine, how
    # many symbols should I add to the machine to be able to assign the tile number i (with i a row number). Of
    # course this number equals the size of the tile.
    # Then, the rest of the matrix is used as usual : M[i][j] = number of symbols I must add to a machine if the
    # last scheduled tile is j and if I want to add the tile i.
    #
    # There will be empty cells for two reasons : 
    #       - There is a condition inherent to the method which is i >= j. So this means half of the matrix is empty
    #       - There are as many rows (and columns) as there are leaves in the starting tree but maybe not all of leaves
    #           are kept in the input. The cells for these not-used leaves are left empty (with an 'x' inside)
